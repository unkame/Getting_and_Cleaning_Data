# Code Book
This code book describes the processed data variables(measurements) in "tidy.txt". Identifiers are the references of the activities, while the measurements are the values taken based on different measures.

## Identifiers
Two identifiers are in the dataset:
- subject: ID of the test subject
- activity: Type of activities performed when relevant measurements were taken

## Identifiers Value Type
There are the information of categories of the two identifiers activities and their subject ID:
- WALKING (subject ID: 1): subject was walking during the test
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (subject ID: 2): subject was walking upstair during the test
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (subject ID: 3): subject was walking downstair during the test
- SITTING (subject ID: 4): subject was sitting during the test
- STANDING (subject ID: 5): subject was standing during the test
- LAYING (subject ID: 6): subject was laying during the test

## Measurements of Activities
There are 79 measurements recorded in the dataset:
